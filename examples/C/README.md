# APO library

The pycarmaker library is a Python class that tries to copy the functionality of the APO library in case you need to write your application in Python.
But if you are writing in C, IPG already has the APO library to help you to write and read quantities.

Here you will find some simple examples. IPG already has a more complex example that you could use as a baseline for you application.
The idea of these examples here is to explain how APO works and better understand the IPG code.

IPG example can be found in the installation folder _IPG\carmaker\win64-8.0.2\Examples\APO_.

# Example 1 - Read quantities

This example will connect to carmaker and read time and vehicle speed.
